\chapter{7 TeV and 8 TeV Differential Cross Section Measurement: \\ Data, Simulation and Selection}
\label{c:Differential_Cross_Section:data_simulation_and_selection}

\section{Outline}
\label{s:analysis1_outline}
This chapter describes the first part of the main \ttbar differential cross section analysis in bins of
global event variables. Following an introduction to the variables under investigation and motivations, the
datasets used and the selection process is explained, including scale factors and corrections applied to ensure agreement between Monte Carlo
simulation and data.

The analysis measures the normalised differential \ttbar cross section in the semi-leptonic channel and is
carried out on 2011 and 2012 data recorded from the CMS detector. The measurement is carried out with respect
to the following global, or primary, variables is carried out:
\begin {itemize}

  \item {\met, the missing transverse energy in an event, defined as the magnitude of the missing transverse
  momentum vector \ptvecmiss}
  	\[\met = \left[ \left(\sum_i{p_{x}^i}\right)^2 + \left(\sum_i{p_{y}^i}\right)^2
  	\right]^{\frac{1}{2}},\]
  	where $p_x^i$ and $p_yi$ are momentum components of the \textit{i}th object in an event, and the sums
  	include all objects in the event.

  \item {\HT, the sum of the transverse momenta of all jets in an event}
	\[\HT = \sum_{\text{all jets}}\pt^{\mathrm{jet}},\]
	where the sum includes all jets with  $\pt>20\GeV$ and $\left|\eta\right|<2.5$.

  \item {\st, the sum of all observed transverse momenta in an event, \ie the scalar sum of \HT, \met, and
  	lepton \pt}
  	\[\st = \HT + \met + p_\mathrm{T}^\mathrm{lepton}.\]

  \item {\wpt, the transverse momentum of the leptonically decaying \W boson, obtained from \met and the \pt
  of the lepton}
	\[\wpt = \sqrt{\left(p_x^{\mathrm{lepton}} + p_x^{\mathrm{miss}}\right)^2 + \left(p_y^{\mathrm{lepton}} +
	p_y^{\mathrm{miss}}\right)^2},\]
	where $p_{x}^{\mathrm{lepton}}$ and $p_{y}^{\mathrm{lepton}}$ are the transverse components of
	$\vec{p}^{\mathrm{lepton}}$, and $p_x^{\mathrm{miss}}$ and $p_y^{\mathrm{miss}}$ are the transverse
	components of \ptvecmiss.

  \item {\mt, the transverse mass of the leptonically decaying \W boson, also obtained from \met and the \pt
  of the lepton}
    \[\mt = \sqrt{\et\left(\text{lepton}, \met\right)^{2} - (\wpt)^{2}},\]
    where $\et\left(\text{lepton}, \met\right)$ is the scalar sum of \met and the transverse energy of the
    lepton, \ie $\met + \et^{\text{lepton}}$
 
\end{itemize}

% Previous analyses using 7\TeV data investigating \met and using 8\TeV data investigatin all the
% global variables listed above can be found in \cite{CMS-PAS-TOP-12-019} and \cite{CMS-PAS-TOP-12-042} respectively.

\section{Data and Simulated Samples}
\label{s:data_and_simulated_samples}

\subsection{Data}
\label{ss:data}

Data collected in 2011 at a centre-of-mass energy of 7\TeV and in 2012 at a centre-of-mass energy of 8\TeV are
used. The datasets are determined by the triggers that were used to record them. For 7\TeV, the ``ElectronHad''
dataset is used in the electron channel. It was recorded with triggers that select based on a single, isolated
electron and additional jets. At 8\TeV, the ``SingleElectron'' dataset was used for the electron channel which is
based only on a single, isolated electron. In the muon channel, the ``SingleMu'' dataset was used for both
centre-of-mass energies, requiring a single, isolated muon.

These datasets are produced from CMS data by requiring events to pass a trigger. The triggers used in both
7\TeV and 8\TeV data are shown in Table\ref{tab:HLTTriggers} in Appendix~\ref{as:datasets}. In the electron
channel, an electron plus jets trigger was used in 2011 with a requirement of electron \Et $>$ 25\GeV and at
least three jets with \pt $>$ 20\GeV; and a single electron trigger was used in 2012 with an electron \Et
requirement of 27\GeV. In the muon channel, a single muon trigger was used in both data taking periods. In
addition to these kinematic requirements, the triggers also have cuts for the electron on the ratio between
the HCAL and the ECAL energy ($H/E$), track matching with ECAL ($\Delta\eta$ and $\Delta\phi$), cluster shape
($\sigma_{i\eta i\eta}$), ECAL isolation ($\frac{\text{ECAL iso}}{E_\text{T}}$), HCAL isolation
($\frac{\text{HCAL iso}}{E_\text{T}}$) and tracker isolation ($\frac{\text{tracker iso}}{\pt}$). In the muon
triggers, similarly, they have additional cuts on\ldots TODO: CURRENTLY WAITING FOR EMAIL REPLY FROM MUON POG.
% TODO: see Luke P76-77 for descriptions of these variables.

The datasets used are shown in Tables~\ref{tab:datasets7TeV} and \ref{tab:datasets8TeV}. %in
%Appendix~\ref{as:datasets}.
Only data that is certified as ``golden'' (data taken with the CMS detector
working without any major faults) is used. The masks used to filter out data taken in other periods are
specified in Table~\ref{tab:JSONfiles} in Appendix~\ref{as:datasets}.

\subsection{Simulated Samples}
\label{ss:simulated_samples}
The Monte Carlo generators used in this analysis are \MADGRAPH \cite{madgraph5}, \PYTHIA \cite{pythia8},
\POWHEG \cite{powheg_Nason, powheg_Frixione, powheg_Alioli}, \HERWIG \cite{herwig} and \MCATNLO
\cite{mcatnlo_Frixione1, mcatnlo_Frixione2}. See Section~\ref{s:monte_carlo_simulation} for more details of
these Monte Carlo generators.

The signal for this analysis is the production of a \ttbar pair which decays semi-leptonically, \ie each of
the \tquarks decays to a \W boson and a \bjet, with one of the \W bosons decaying hadronically to two jets and
the other decaying leptonically to a lepton (electron or muon) and an associated neutrino.
Section~\ref{c:top_physics_at_the_lhc} outlines the signal and background events considered. Additional, lower
energy jets, can be produced from other scatterings in the same proton-proton interaction and from gluon
radiation from quarks in the decay. See Section~\ref{c:top_physics_at_the_lhc} for detailed descriptions of
the signal and backgrounds in this analysis.

Tables~\ref{tab:signaldatasets7TeV} and~\ref{tab:signaldatasets8TeV} show the Monte Carlo signal samples used
in this analysis at 7\TeV and 8\TeV respectively. Tables~\ref{tab:backgrounddatasets7TeV}
and~\ref{tab:backgrounddatasets7TeV} %in Appendix~\ref{as:datasets} 
list the background simulation samples
used. Top pair production is modelled using \MADGRAPH, single top events are modelled with \POWHEG, \W and \Z boson plus jets production is
modelled using \MADGRAPH and QCD multi-jet events are modelled with \PYTHIA. In all cases, \PYTHIA is used to
model radiation and hadronisation processes. Tables~\ref{tab:7TeVsystematicdatasets} and
\ref{tab:8TeVsystematicdatasets} show the samples used to evaluate the factorisation scale, matching
threshold, and top quark mass uncertainties. \WpJets and \ZpJets samples were not made available at 7\TeV, so
the scaled distributions from 8\TeV were used, as described in
Section~\ref{sss:7TeV_vjets_theory_systematic_template}.

\section{Selection}
\label{s:selection}
Selection algorithms are run on the data and samples listed in Sections~\ref{s:data_and_simulated_samples} and
\ref{ss:simulated_samples} to identify \ttbar events. The selection process is performed in two stages: a
``pre-selection'' using loose criteria to produce ntuples and a second full selection when processing these
ntuples to produce the final sample. The selection used follows the recommended criteria by
the CMS TOP Physics Analysis Group (PAG) and is the same for 7\TeV and 8\TeV.

\subsection{Preselection}
\label{ss:preselection}
The preselection is performed on the AOD datasets, with the aim of making the resulting ntuples smaller
in size but still versatile enough for use later in the analysis chain.

The preselection requires at least one good primary vertex with at least four degrees of freedom,
located within 24\cm~ of the centre of the CMS detector in the $z$ direction and within 2\cm~ of the centre of
the beam trajectory in the transverse plane. In addition, events are required to have at least one lepton
candidate. In the case of electrons, a transverse energy of at least 30\GeV and \abseta $<$ 2.5 and in the
muon channel a transverse momentum of at least 20\GeV and \abseta $<$ 2.1 are required. 

Several filters are also applied in the preselection stage to remove events with significant levels of noise
due to elements of the detector with sub-optimal performance during data-taking. These filters include an HCAL
noise filter to remove events with high HCAL noise, a tracking failure filter to remove events with too few
tracks, ECAL filters to remove events with signals in dead and/or noisy modules of the ECAL and a beam
scraping veto which requires tracks of high purity in events with high track multiplicity.

\subsection{Electron selection}
\label{electronplusjetschannelselection}
The final selection in the electron+jets channel follows that recommended by the CMS TOP Physics Analysis
Group (PAG). After having passed the electron trigger, events are further required to have an electron with an
MVA electron identification of $>0.5$, with \Et $> 30\GeV$ and $\abseta < 2.5$ (excluding the transition
region between the ECAL barrel and endcap of $1.4442 < \abseta < 1.5660$). A transverse impact parameter, the
distance between the electron and the primary vertex, of $d_{xy} < 0.02\cm$ is also required. In addition, a
$\rho$ corrected (explained in Section \ref{ss:pileup_subtraction}) relative isolation of $< 0.1$, within a
cone of size $\Delta R = 0.3$ is required and electrons that are matched to a photon conversion are rejected.
A veto on additional electrons with looser identification criteria than the signal requirements mentioned here
include an MVA identification of $> 0.5$, \Et $> 20\GeV$, $\abseta < 2.5$ and a $\rho$ corrected relative
isolation of $<0.15$.

\subsection{Muon selection}
\label{muonplusjetschannelselection}
As in the electron channel, the final selection in the muon channel is taken from the CMS TOP PAG
recommendations. In this case, the muon identification requirement comprises several cuts: at least five hits
in the tracker and at least one hit in the muon chambers associated to the track, at least one layer of the
muon chamber hits must be matched to a global muon (described in Section~\ref{ss:muon_reconstruction}), and
the inner track must include at least one hit in the pixel sub detector. Furthermore, the normalised
chi-squared of the track fit should be less than 10. In addition, the muon identification algorithms should
identify the particle as a global, particle flow (PF) muon, the muon track should pass within a z-distance of
$d_{z} < 0.5\cm$ of the primary vertex and the transverse impact parameter is required to be $d_{xy} <
0.2\cm$. The signal selection also requires that the muon has a $\pt > 26\GeV$, $\abseta < 2.1$ and a
$\Delta\beta$ corrected (explained in Section \ref{ss:pileup_subtraction}) relative isolation of $< 0.12$,
within a cone of size $\Delta R = 0.4$. Loose muons are vetoed, that satisfy the looser requirements of
passing the particle flow identification, $\pt > 10\GeV$, $\abseta < 2.5$ and a $\Delta\beta$ corrected
relative isolation $<0.2$.

\subsection{Jets selection}
\label{jets_selection}
In addition to the signal lepton, all events must also have at least four particle flow jets as reconstructed
using the anti-kt algorithm (see Section~\ref{ss:jet_reconstruction}) with a cone of $\Delta R = 0.5$. These
jets are also required to have \pt $> 30\GeV$, $\abseta < 2.5$, be at least $\Delta R = 0.3$ from the signal
electron or muon and satisfy the criteria for the loose particle flow jet identification. These criteria are
outlined in Section~\ref{ss:jet_reconstruction}. Candidate particle flow jets from pileup are removed from the
event; this is known as charged hadron subtraction. Events with at least four jets passing these criteria are
permitted to have other lower energy jets passing the same requirements mentioned above, down to $\pt =
20\GeV$. At least two of the four primary jets are further required to originate from b quarks (the process of
identifying b jets is explained in Section~\ref{ss:b_tagging}.)

\subsection{Multi-jet background selection}
\label{ss:background_selection}
The QCD background is difficult to model in simulation, therefore this background distribution is modelled
from data. In the electron+jets channel, a control region comprised primarily of QCD events in the
photon conversion region can be obtained by applying the full event selection with the exception of an
inverted conversion veto, \ie the veto on electrons that are matched to a photon conversion is reversed such
that events will only pass the selection if they are matched to a photon converison. The $\geq 2$ b tags
requirement is also relaxed to select only events with 0 \btags to enrich the selection with QCD events. In
order to evaluate a systematic uncertainty on the shape of this QCD background, an alternative control region is obtained by using the full signal selection but with the electron isolation requirement changed from
$< 0.1$ to $> 0.2$.

In the case of the muon+jets channel, the full selection is applied with the exception of the muon relative
isolation requirement, which is switched from $< 0.12$ to $> 0.3$ and with the b tag requirement reduced to
only events with 0 b tags in order to remove most other \ttbar background processes and produce a high purity
QCD sample, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:muon_qcd_isolation}. In order to increase statistics the jet
multiplicity requirement is reduced to require at least three jets.

Due to the low statistics of the QCD samples obtained from data, the inclusive QCD sample over all
bins is used in every bin for each primary variable. The remaining contribution from \ttbar,
single-top and \W/\ZpJets processes is subtracted from the data sample using the estimation from
Monte Carlo simulation. The resulting template of QCD events from data is then used later in the fitting
procedure, in place of the equivalent Monte Carlo template.

      $\roots=8\TeV$]{PF relative isolation distributions in the muon+jets channel, before subtraction of
      \ttbar, single top and \VpJets at $\roots=7\TeV$ (left) and $\roots=8\TeV$ (right).}
     \label{fig:muon_qcd_isolation}
\end{figure}

A comparison between data and simulation in the electron+jets QCD selections is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:data_mc_comparison_electron_QCD}. There is reasonably good agreement between the data and
simulation in the conversion selection but low statistics in the simulation lead to some events with large
weights, leading to peaks in the distribution.
%It can also be seen that there are more conversion events in the regions of the endcaps, where the larger
% amount of detector material for electrons to traverse leads to a higher number of conversions.
The non-isolated QCD selection shows more discrepancies between the simulation
and data, but it should be noted that at $\roots=7\TeV$ the simulation does not contain the triggers used in
this analysis, unlike at $\roots=8\TeV$, therefore the simulation distribution at $\roots=7\TeV$ is not
affected by the trigger isolation requirements.

The true QCD background distribution is a mixture of the conversion and non-isolated distributions. A
comparison of the two QCD background selections at $\roots=7\TeV$ and $\roots=8\TeV$ is also shown in the
lower plots in Figure~\ref{fig:data_mc_comparison_electron_QCD}. Background events in which electrons come
from jets misreconstructed as electrons or from \bquark or \cquark decays will pass the non-isolated
selection, whereas conversion events in which the second electron is not rejected by the electron veto will
pass the conversion selection. Another point to note is that, while the general shape of the conversion
selection is expected to be the same in both signal and QCD background selections, the same may not be true of
the non-isolated selection due to the isolation requirement in the signal selection. In addition, the number
of events passing the QCD background selections will be very small compared to the number of events passing
the signal selection, so the effect of even large uncertainties in the QCD background on the total number of
events will be minimal. In the muon+jets channel, similarly, it is clear that the data and simulation are not
in agreement and that there is a low amount of statistics available in simulation.

\section{Data-MC scale factors}
\label{s:data_mc_scale_factors}
There exist small but significant discrepancies between data and simulation distributions regarding pileup
modelling; b tagging; trigger, identification and isolation efficiency; jet energy scale and jet energy
resolution, and \met calculation. Scale factors and corrections are applied to both MC and data to account for
these differences. The data-MC scale factors used are in accordance with the CMS TOP PAG, and the relevant
corrections are implemented for 7\TeV and 8\TeV.

\subsection{Pileup}
\label{ss:pileup}
Monte Carlo simulation events are produced by first creating the hard proton-proton interaction of interest in
a proton bunch crossing, and then introducing the additional interactions, pileup, are added. The pileup
distribution in simulation does not reflect the true distribution in data, therefore pileup reweighting is
carried out. The instantaneous luminosity is used to estimate the number of pilup instances in an event at
$\roots=7\TeV$ and $\roots=8\TeV$ using a tool provided by the CMS Physics Validation Group. For each number
of pileup interactions in simulation, a weight is then produced to match the respective distribution in data.

The estimation of the pileup distribution in data is obtained using the instantaneous luminosity measured in
each proton bunch crossing, and the total inelastic proton-proton cross section. There is an uncertainty on
the measured luminosity which is currently 2.6\% for 2012 data \cite{CMS:2013gfa} and 2.2\% for 2011 data
\cite{CMS:2012eui}. The total inelastic cross section has been reported using CMS forward calorimetry
\cite{Chatrchyan:2012gwa} and by the TOTEM collaboration \cite{Antchev:2011vs}. Based on these findings, the
CMS recommended central values of 68\mb~ for $\roots=7$ and 69.3\mb~ for $\roots=8$ have been used, with a
$\pm5\%$ uncertainty to account for pileup and physics modelling in simulation. The distributions of the
number of reconstructed of vertices before and after applying pileup reweighting in the electron+jets channel
is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:nvertices_before_and_after_pileup_reweighting_electrons}, and in the muon+jets
channel is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:nvertices_before_and_after_pileup_reweighting_muons} in Appendix~\ref{as:data_monte_carlo_corrections}.
The distributions show good agreement after reweighting.

     Both data and sum of MC simulations are normalisated to one.}
     \label{fig:nvertices_before_and_after_pileup_reweighting_electrons}
\end{figure}

\subsection{\btagging}
\label{ss:b_tagging}
The combined secondary vertex \btagging algorithm (CSV) described in Section~\ref{sss:b_jets} is used in this
analysis to identify jets originating from \bquarks in \ttbar events. The medium working point, CSVM, which
corresponds to a cut on the discriminator output by the algorithm of 0.679, is used in this analysis.
Discrepancies between the \btagging efficiency in data and Monte Carlo simulation have been noted in
$\roots=7\TeV$ \cite{Chatrchyan:2012jua} and $\roots=8\TeV$ \cite{CMS-PAS-BTV-13-001}. To account for these
differences, events are reweighted based on the recommendation of the CMS \btagging Physics Object Group
(POG), with the aim of ensuring that the probability of an event passing selection criteria in simulation
matches the probability of an even in data with the same jet(s) passing the same selection. The result of this
reweighting in the electron+jets channel is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:nbjets_before_and_after_btag_scale_factors_electrons}, and in the muon+jets channel in
Figure~\ref{fig:nbjets_before_and_after_btag_scale_factors_muons} in
Appendix~\ref{as:data_monte_carlo_corrections} .
The \btagging efficiency uncertainty is evaluated by varying the scale factors by $\pm1\sigma$.

%At bins of lower multiplicity, there is a clear excess in the data distribution over the simulation, but
% since only the $\geq2$ \btags region is used for the signal region, this disagreement in low bins is not of
% importance.  %TODO: mention also not important because of fitting?

\subsection{Jet Energy Scale}
\label{sss:jet_energy_scale}
Jet energies are corrected to take into account energy coming from other sources. Level 1 (L1 Pileup)
corrections remove energy that comes from pileup collisions, Level 2 (L2 Relative) corrections remove the
dependence of jet response on $\eta$, and Level 3 (L3 Absolute) corrections correct for the jet response
dependence on \pt \cite{Chatrchyan:2011ds}. These corrections are applied to both data and Monte Carlo
simulation events. An additional residual correction (L2L3Residual) is applied to data only for fine tuning of the agreement between data and
simulation.

Furthermore, jet energy resolution corrections are applied (known as jet smearing) to account for the fact
that jet energy resolution has been measured to be worse in data than in simulation. These PF jet corrections
are provided by the CMS JETMET Physics Object Group using 0.8\fbinv of dijet data at
$\roots=7\TeV$~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011ds} and 19.7\fbinv of dijet data at $\roots=8\TeV$ \cite{jet_res_2012}.

\subsection{Missing Transverse Energy Corrections}
\label{ss:met_corrections}
The adjustments to the jet energies as a result of the corrections mentioned in
Section~\ref{sss:jet_energy_scale} in turn affect the distributions of \met and \met $\phi$ in the event.
Corrections known as Type-I \met corrections are applied to propagate these changes to the \met distributions.
In addition, Type-0 corrections are applied to account for pileup interactions in the event, and \met $\phi$
corrections are applied to mitigate a known modulation of the \met distribution with respect to $\phi$.
 
\subsection{Trigger, Lepton ID and Isolation Efficiencies and Corrections}
\label{ss:trigger_ID_isolation_corrections}
Corrections are also required for the trigger, identification and isolation efficiencies for muons and
electrons. In the muon+jets channel, the corrections were provided by the CMS muon Physics Object Group
for $\roots=8\TeV$ TODO:FINDREF (ONLY A TWIKI, WOULD THIS BE OK?) %TODO:FINDREF
and $\roots=7\TeV$ \cite{CMS-PAS-SMP-13-013}.

For the electron+jets channel, the corrections were provided by the CMS EGamma Physics Object Group for
$\roots=8\TeV$, TODO:FINDREF (ONLY A TWIKI, WOULD THIS BE OK?) %TODO:FINDREF
however the corrections for the $\roots=7\TeV$ data were not provided and so were derived independently in
this analysis using the same tag and probe methods as used by the EGamma POG.

The 7\TeV triggers used (ElectronHad) in this analysis were not present in the 7\TeV simulation,
and so the trigger efficiency was calculated with respect to the full selection. This efficiency was then
implemented in the Monte Carlo simulation, thereby imitating the trigger. It should be noted that it is
assumed that the electron and hadron legs of the trigger are not correlated, since electrons are cleaned from
the jet collection at HLT level.

A tag and probe method~\cite{CMS:2011aa} was used to derive identification, isolation scale factors and
electron trigger efficiencies. The full reference selection was first applied with the exception of trigger,
\btagging and electron veto requirements, while in addition, a second loose electron was required. A \Z mass
constraint was placed on the two electrons in the event by requiring them to have an invariant mass of between
60\GeV and 120\GeV, thus ensuring that the pair of electrons originated from a \Z boson decay. The tight
('tag') electron requirements were \pt$>$30\GeV, \abseta$<$0.8, relative isolation$<$0.1, MVA
identification$>$0.9, $d_{xy}<0.02\cm$ and reconstructed at HLT level. The loose ('probe') electron
requirements were \pt$>$30\GeV, \abseta$<$2.5 and $d_{xy}<2\cm$.

Fits were then performed, firstly of the invariant mass of all pairs of tag and probe electrons, and secondly
after applying the identification and isolation criteria to the probe electrons, to the invariant mass
distribution of pairs of tag and probe electrons in which the probe electron passed the identification and
isolation criteria. The fit was implemented in both Monte Carlo simulation and in data, and a Breit-Wigner
distribution convoluted with a Crystal Ball function is used to model the invariant mass of the tag and probe
electrons, with a falling exponential used to model the background distribution. The Breit-Wigner distribution
takes a form similar to that of a Gaussian distribution, with flatter tails~\cite{PhysRev.49.519}. The Crystal
Ball function is also based on a Gaussian distribution, but with a power-law tail to the lower end
~\cite{Oreglia,Gaiser,Skwarnicki}. Both of these functions are commonly used to model the mass peaks of
resonances. The result of this fitting procedure in data can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:electron_id_iso_efficiency_invariant_Z_mass_fits_data}.

\end{figure}

The efficiency of the identification and isolation process is then calculated using the numbers extracted
from the fits, in bins of \pt and $\eta$ of the probe electron, as follows:

\begin{equation}
\epsilon(\text{identification and isolation}) = \frac{N^{\text{fit}}_{\text{probe, passing}}}{N^{\text{fit}}_{\text{probe, all}}}
\end{equation}
where $N^{\text{fit}}_{\text{probe, all}}$ is the total number of events with tag and probe electrons and
$N^{\text{fit}}$ is the subset in which the probe passes identification and isolation criteria.

The scale factor is then calculated as the ratio between the efficiencies in simulation and in data. The
efficiencies in both can be seen to be similar in Figure~\ref{fig:electron_id_iso_efficiencies_wrt_eta_pt},
leading to scale factors close to one.

     \label{fig:electron_id_iso_efficiencies_wrt_eta_pt}
\end{figure}

The efficiency of the electron part of the trigger is then similarly calculated, with respect to the
identification and isolation requirements, meaning the events passing the identification and isolation
requirements in the previous stage are then used as the baseline for the trigger efficiency. The subset of
these in which the probe electron matches a HLT electron is then used to calculate the efficiency as follows:

\begin{equation}
\epsilon(\text{trigger}) = \frac{N^{\text{fit}}_{\text{probe, matching HLT}}}{N^{\text{fit}}_{\text{probe,identification and isolation}}}
\label{eq:electron_leg_efficiency}
\end{equation}
where $N^{\text{fit}}_{\text{probe,identification and isolation}}$ is the number of
events passing from equation~\ref{eq:electron_leg_efficiency} and $N^{\text{fit}}_{\text{probe, matching
HLT}}$ is the subset in which the probe is matched to an HLT electron object.

In order to calculate the efficiency of the hadron leg of the trigger, the full selection with only the
electron part of the trigger and without \btagging, applied to the SingleElectron dataset, is taken as the
baseline. The number of these events passing the hadronic leg of the trigger is then used to calculate the
hadronic leg efficiency as follows:

\begin{equation}
\epsilon(\text{hadron leg}) = \frac{N_{\text{hadron leg, passing}}}{N_{\text{passing selection}}}
\end{equation}
where $N_{\text{passing selection}}$ is the number of events passing the baseline selection with
the electron leg of the trigger and no \btagging requirements, and $N_{\text{hadron leg, passing}}$ is the
subset in which the hadron leg of the trigger is satisfied.

The scale factors are produced in bins of \pt and $\eta$ of the fourth most energetic jet, since this is the
lowest energy jet that is selected. Parametrising as a function of higher energy jets would lead to a bias
towards high efficiencies as the trigger will have a higher efficiency at higher jet energies.

Equivalent fit and efficiency plots for the trigger are included in
Figures~\ref{fig:electron_trigger_efficiency_invariant_Z_mass_fits} and
\ref{fig:electron_trigger_efficiencies_wrt_eta_pt} in Appendix~\ref{as:data_monte_carlo_corrections}.
TODO:HAVE NOT INCLUDED MUON ID-ISO OR TRIGGER PLOTS ANYWHERE, ASSUMING OK WITH JUST ELECTRON PLOTS.
